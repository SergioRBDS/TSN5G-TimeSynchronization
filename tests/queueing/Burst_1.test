%description:

In this test, packets are periodically (randomly) produced by two active sources
(ActivePacketSources). One source produces packets with a slower rate while the other
source uses a faster rate. The two packet sources are combined using a markov
chain with random transition matrix and random wait intervals. The packets are
consumed by a single passive sink (PassivePacketSink).
