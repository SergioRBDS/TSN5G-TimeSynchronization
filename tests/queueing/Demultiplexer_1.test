%description:

In this test, packets are collected periodically (randomly) by several active
packet sinks (ActivePacketSinks). The packets are provided by a single passive
packet source upon request (PassivePacketSource). The single source is connected to
the multiple sinks using an intermediary component (PacketDemultiplexer) which
simply forwards packets.
