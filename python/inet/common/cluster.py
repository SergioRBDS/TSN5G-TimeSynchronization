class SSHCluster:
    """
    Represents an SSH cluster. An SSH cluster is basically a set of network nodes, most often connected to a single LAN,
    all of which can login into each other using SSH passwordless login. The SSH cluster utilizes all network nodes with
    automatic and transparent load balancing as if it were a single computer.

    There are a couple of pitfalls that can prevent the SSH cluster from working correctly. If you encounter problems
    with the SSH cluster, make sure the following conditions are met:

    - scheduler and worker node hostnames can be resolved to IP addresses on all nodes
    - all nodes can SSH login into all other nodes (even themselves!) without any user interaction (no password is required)
    - the Python version and all required Python library versions are the same on all nodes
    - no firewall rule prevents the scheduler to connect to the workers
    - simulation projects are compiled both in release and debug versions
