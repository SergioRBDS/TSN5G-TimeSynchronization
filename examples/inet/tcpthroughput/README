For studying how TCP (and its various flavors) tolerate long link delays.

Run the Experiment parameter study, then plot the sum of the tcpRcvPayloadBytes
statistics of the TCP connection in the server. You can make the parameter study
cover more input variations by uncommenting the lines that define more iteration
values.

Observe that larger link delays necessitate larger advertised windows for TCP to
produce throughputs that are near the link capacity.
