## About time synchronization between TSN and 5G

Integrating Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and wireless networks, like the Fifth Generation of mobile networks (5G), affords deterministic communication with great flexibility and mobility, enabling new services to be used in smart industries.

This work aims to provide advances in simulating this integration using the OMNeT++ simulator and developing extended modules to support it.

The time synchronization between TSN and 5G is made based on 3GPP Release 17, capable of synchronization in every supported direction using the 5G as a time-aware system.
